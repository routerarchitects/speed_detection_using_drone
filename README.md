# speed_detection_using_drone
This repository contains the implementation of a computer vision system for detecting and analyzing the speed of objects using a drone-mounted camera. The project involves real-time object detection, motion analysis, and speed estimation in dynamic environments where both the camera (drone) and objects are in motion.
